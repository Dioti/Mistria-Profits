			<h1>Mistria Profits</h1>
			<p>Mistria Profits is a calculation and graphing tool designed to help the players of the indie farming sim "Fields of Mistria" to easily calculate and compare their profits from planting different crops under different conditions.</p>
			<h1>Usage</h1>
			<p>The tool is split up to two sections: graph box and options box. The options box lets the user quickly change the parameters which are then reflected on the graph.</p>
			<h2>Graph Box</h2>
			<p>The graph box displays a live rendered graph based on the options that the user has set. The number of bars changes based on the set conditions (like different seasons). The profit in tesserae can be viewed on the side as a scale. The graph shows both profit and loss. Additionally, if the seed buying loss is selected, the loss will be shown in orange. Hovering the mouse over a crop will show a tooltip with information about profits, loss and more. Pressing on a crop will open the official Wiki page for that crop, or you can disable this feature selecting the "Disable Links" option.</p>
			<h2>Options Box</h2>
			<p>The following table describes all the options and how they affect the graph.</p>
			<table cellspacing="4">
  				<col width="25%">
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Option</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Season</td>
						<td>Changes the season of the crops. This will affect list of the crops shown in the graph, as only some crops grow at certain seasons. Additionally, all seasons have a limit of 28 maximum days for calculation.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Current Day</td>
						<td>The current date within the selected season. The value is subtracted from the previous <em>Number of days</em> to calculate how many days the crops have time to grow.</td>
					</tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Number of Days</td>
                        <td>Designates the number of days to be used in the calculation. The shorter the duration, the less crops will have time to grow. Some crops might not have time to grow even once if a too low value is set. This value cannot be changed currently.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Number of Crops</td>
                        <td>This controls the number of crops that the player has planted.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Profit Display</td>
                        <td>Changes how the graph is organized. ROI is calculated by dividing the profit by the expenses. Daily is calculated through the number of days set earlier.</td>
                    </tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Max Seed Money</td>
						<td>The maximum amount of money available in player's savings. This will limit how many crops can be planted when buying seeds.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Pay For Seeds</td>
						<td>Selecting this means that the player is buying the seeds from one of the sources, instead of producing the seeds themselves. An orange bar will be shown for every crop, showing the seed loss if selected.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Show Extra Info</td>
						<td>Selecting this will show additional detailed info about every crop on the tooltip.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Disable Links</td>
						<td>Selecting this will disable opening the wiki when the bar graph is clicked.</td>
					</tr>
