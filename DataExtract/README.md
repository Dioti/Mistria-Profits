# Data Extract

## Summary
Extract and export relevant data used in Mistria Profits.

## Description
A very crude script used to extract relevant crop data from `__fiddle__.json` and export it in a JSON format. Copies relevant crop icons from the game's exported sprites. Written by Dioti.

## Instructions
1) Download the UndertaleModTool: https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool
2) Use the UndertaleModTool to extract game sprites to your game folder. (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fields of Mistria\Export_Sprites`)
3) Copy `DataExtract.jar` and `extract.bat` to the game folder. (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fields of Mistria`)
4) Double-click the `extract.bat` file to run it.
5) An output folder called `export` will be created containing the extracted data.

## Troubleshooting
- If the path or file isn't found, try opening `extract.bat` in Notepad and edit the values manually.
